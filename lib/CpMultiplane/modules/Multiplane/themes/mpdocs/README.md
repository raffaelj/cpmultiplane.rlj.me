# mpdocs theme for CpMultiplane

This theme is optimized for documentations with markdown as content fields. It is a child theme of `rljbase`.

You should use the [BetterMarkdown][2] addon to prevent rendering markdown content on the fly with each page request and to be able to use a table of contents.

## Credits and third party resources

I used [highlight.js][1] for syntax highlighting.
