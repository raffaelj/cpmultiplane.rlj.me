# My current workflow doesn't involve Github releases - I only use `git tag` to manage releases.
# So I trigger this workflow on push events and check for changed tags later.
# If I switch to automated releases on new tags, I have to adjust this job.

  push:
    branches: 
      - master
    tags:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # run only if the push event has a new tag
    if: github.event_name == 'push' && contains(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
